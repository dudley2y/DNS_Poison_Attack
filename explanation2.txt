Idea:   there are a lot of ports 
        there are a lot of potential txid 
        have a (dstPort, srcPort, txid) => None | ip   
            
        if we've already seen a ip at that specific permutation then someone sent a spoofed packet because the likelyhood of 2 dns requests with the same mapping is so small.
        if none -> save packet info for later

        because there are so many ports x ports x txid permutations, collisions are very unlikely. 

Test: 

        1. Run dnsinjection.py 
        2. Run dnsdetect.py 
        3. In linux terminal, dig a specified spoofed url
